﻿/* Introduction
 *
 * VoodooSauce is a Unity SDK that we implement into all of our games here at Voodoo.  This SDK is responsible for
 * providing Ads, Analytics, IAP, GDPR, etc. functionality in an easy to use package for internal and external studios
 * to integrate into their games. The SDK is used around the world by more than 200+ games, thus reliability and ease of use is
 * incredibly important for us. 
 *
 * For this exercise, we would like you to create a basic VoodooSauce that integrates the fake "TopAds" and "TopAnalytics"
 * SDKs.
 *
 * At the end we ask that you answer some quick questions at the bottom of this file. 
 * 
 */

/* Instructions 
 *
 * Please fill out the method implementations below 
 * Feel free to create additional classes to help with your implementation 
 * Please do not spend more than 2.5 hours on the code implementation portion of this exercise
 * Please do not modify the code in the 3rdParty folder
 * Make sure to read this entire file before starting to code.  We include important instructions on how to use the TopAds and TopAnalytics SDKs
